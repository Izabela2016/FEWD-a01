##Introduction


My name is **Izabela Wysocka**. I graduated from **University of Technology** in Warsaw with *Master of Science and Engineering*. With encouragement from family and friends, I started the School of Economics in Warsaw and graduated with license of Property Management. First 4 years of my career I spent in JVC creating and developing car audio business within specialist sales network. Next 6 years I was sales representative in Polish Oil and Gas Company SA, where I was responsible for negotiate gas sale agreements with the largest customers.

In 2005 I met my husband Maciej, who completely changed my life. 
* 2012 Minneapolis

After couple years living together in Warsaw Maciej's company Sony offered him a job in the US. We moved to our first place- Minneapolis. 
* 2013 San Jose

Year later we moved to San Jose. During this time I was travaling. I visited a lot of big cites in the US, collected pictures and memories. 
* 2014 San Diego

After two good years, we moved once again, this time to San Diego hoping that this city becomes our home for good. Long time I couldn't find my way. Since september I studied the _**Interactive Media Certificate Program**_ and _**Designing and developing for the Web site.**_, what brings a lot of stress and happiness.
